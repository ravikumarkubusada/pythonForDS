Little more gyan to this:
We can use else clause with the try block, the else block will only run when there is no exception raised. For eg.
try:
f = open('some-file.txt')
except IOError:
print("File doesn't exist :-(")
else:
print("File exists!")
finally:
f.close()

Simple way:
try:
print("I'll try not to raise an exception.")
except:
print("I will catch the exception if try block raises any")
else:
print("I will run if Mr try did not raise any exception")
finally:
print("Finally: I'm going to run anyway. Nobody can stop me :P")
